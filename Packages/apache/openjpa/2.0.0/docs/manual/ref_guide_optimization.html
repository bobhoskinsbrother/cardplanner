There are numerous techniques you can use in order to ensure that OpenJPA
operates in the fastest and most efficient manner. Following are some
guidelines. Each describes what impact it will have on performance and
scalability. Note that general guidelines regarding performance or scalability
issues are just that - guidelines. Depending on the particular characteristics
of your application, the optimal settings may be considerably different than
what is outlined below.
    </p><p>
In the following table, each row is labeled with a list of italicized keywords.
These keywords identify what characteristics the row in question may improve
upon. Many of the rows are marked with one or both of the <span class="emphasis"><em>performance
</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>scalability</em></span> labels. It is important to bear
in mind the differences between performance and scalability (for the most part,
we are referring to system-wide scalability, and not necessarily only
scalability within a single JVM). The performance-related hints will probably
improve the performance of your application for a given user load, whereas the
scalability-related hints will probably increase the total number of users that
your application can service. Sometimes, increasing performance will decrease
scalability, and vice versa. Typically, options that reduce the amount of work
done on the database server will improve scalability, whereas those that push
more work onto the server will have a negative impact on scalability.

The default set of indexes created by OpenJPA's mapping tool may not always be 
the most appropriate for your application. Manually setting indexes in your 
mapping metadata or manually manipulating database indexes to include 
frequently-queried fields (as well as dropping indexes on rarely-queried 
fields) can yield significant performance benefits.
                        <p>
A database must do extra work on insert, update, and delete to maintain an
index. This extra work will benefit selects with WHERE clauses, which will
execute much faster when the terms in the WHERE clause are appropriately
indexed. So, for a read-mostly application, appropriate indexing will slow down
updates (which are rare) but greatly accelerate reads. This means that the
system as a whole will be faster, and also that the database will experience
less load, meaning that the system will be more scalable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Bear in mind that over-indexing is a bad thing, both for scalability and
performance, especially for applications that perform lots of inserts, updates,
or deletes.

features in a transaction that will delete, modify, or create a very large

perform periodic flushes during your transaction to reduce its memory

<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../javadoc/org/apache/openjpa/persistence/OpenJPAEntityManager.html" target="_top">

large mode have to more aggressively flush items from the data cache.
                        <p>
If your transaction will visit objects that you know are very unlikely to be
accessed by other transactions, for example an exhaustive report run only once a
month, you can turn off population of the data cache so that the transaction
doesn't fill the entire data cache with objects that won't be accessed again.

Setting <code class="literal">IgnoreChanges</code> to <code class="literal">true</code> will help
performance, since dirty objects can be ignored for queries, meaning that
incremental flushing or client-side processing is not necessary. It will also

Using datastore transactions translates into pessimistic database row locking, 
which can be a performance hit (depending on the database). If appropriate for 
your application, optimistic transactions are typically faster than datastore 
transactions.
                        <p>
Optimistic transactions provide the same transactional guarantees as datastore
transactions, except that you must handle a potential optimistic verification
exception at the end of a transaction instead of assuming that a transaction
will successfully complete. In many applications, it is unlikely that different
concurrent transactions will operate on the same set of data at the same time,
so optimistic verification increases the concurrency, and therefore both the
performance and scalability characteristics, of the application. A common
approach to handling optimistic verification exceptions is to simply present the
end user with the fact that concurrent modifications happened, and require that
the user redo any work.

Using aggregates to compute reporting data on the database server can

Attaching and even persisting instances can be more efficient when your detached
objects use detached state managers. By default, OpenJPA does not use detached
state managers when serializing an instance across tiers. See

If your queries depend on parameter data only known at runtime, you should use 
query parameters rather than dynamically building different query strings. 
OpenJPA performs aggressive caching of query compilation data, and the 
effectiveness of this cache is diminished if multiple query filters are used 
where a single one could have sufficed.

The <a href="ref_guide_fetch.html" title="7.&nbsp; Fetch Groups">fetch groups</a> used when loading an 
object control how much data is eagerly loaded, and by extension, which fields 
must be lazily loaded at a future time. The ideal fetch group configuration 
loads all the data that is needed in one fetch, and no extra fields - this 
minimizes both the amount of data transferred from the database, and the
number of trips to the database.
                        <p>
If extra fields are specified in the fetch groups (in particular, large fields
such as binary data, or relations to other persistence-capable objects), then
network overhead (for the extra data) and database processing (for any necessary
additional joins) will hurt your application's performance. If too few fields
are specified in the fetch groups, then OpenJPA will have to make additional
trips to the database to load additional fields as necessary.

Outside of a Java EE 5 application server or other JPA persistence container,
OpenJPA's EntityManagers use finalizers to ensure that resources
get cleaned up. If you are properly managing your resources, this finalization
is not necessary, and will introduce unneeded synchronization, leading to
scalability problems. You can disable this protective behavior by setting the
<code class="literal">openjpa.BrokerImpl</code> property to
<code class="literal">non-finalizing</code>. See <a href="ref_guide_runtime.html#ref_guide_runtime_broker_finalization" title="1.1.&nbsp; Broker Finalization">Section&nbsp;1.1, &#8220;
