Eager fetching is the ability to efficiently load subclass data and related
objects along with the base instances being queried. Typically, OpenJPA has to
make a trip to the database whenever a relation is loaded, or when you first
access data that is mapped to a table other than the least-derived superclass
table. If you perform a query that returns 100 <code class="classname">Person</code>
objects, and then you have to retrieve the <code class="classname">Address</code> for
each person, OpenJPA may make as many as 101 queries (the initial query, plus
one for the address of each person returned). Or if some of the <code class="classname">
Person</code> instances turn out to be <code class="classname">Employee</code>s,
where <code class="classname">Employee</code> has additional data in its own joined
table, OpenJPA once again might need to make extra database trips to access the
additional employee data. With eager fetching, OpenJPA can reduce these cases to
a single query.
        </p><p>
Eager fetching only affects relations in the active fetch groups, and is limited
by the declared maximum fetch depth and field recursion depth (see
<a href="ref_guide_fetch.html" title="7.&nbsp; Fetch Groups">Section&nbsp;7, &#8220;
            Fetch Groups
        &#8221;</a>). In other words, relations that would
not normally be loaded immediately when retrieving an object or accessing a
field are not affected by eager fetching. In our example above, the address of
each person would only be eagerly fetched if the query were configured to
include the address field or its fetch group, or if the address were in the
default fetch group. This allows you to control exactly which fields are eagerly
fetched in different situations. Similarly, queries that exclude subclasses
aren't affected by eager subclass fetching, described below.
        </p><p>
Eager fetching has three modes:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<code class="literal">none</code>: No eager fetching is performed. Related objects are
always loaded in an independent select statement. No joined subclass data is
loaded unless it is in the table(s) for the base type being queried. Unjoined
subclass data is loaded using separate select statements rather than a SQL UNION
operation.
                </p></li><li><p>
                <a class="indexterm" name="d0e26676"></a>
<code class="literal">join</code>: In this mode, OpenJPA joins to to-one relations in the
configured fetch groups. If OpenJPA is loading data for a single instance, then
OpenJPA will also join to any collection field in the configured fetch groups.
When loading data for multiple instances, though, (such as when executing a
<code class="classname">Query</code>) OpenJPA will not join to collections by default.
Instead, OpenJPA defaults to <code class="literal">parallel</code> mode for collections,
as described below. You can force OpenJPA use a join rather than parallel mode
for a collection field using the metadata extension described in
<a href="ref_guide_mapping_ext.html#eager-fetch-mode" title="9.2.1.&nbsp; Eager Fetch Mode">Section&nbsp;9.2.1, &#8220;
                    Eager Fetch Mode
                &#8221;</a>.
                </p><p>
                <a class="indexterm" name="d0e26695"></a>
Under <code class="literal">join</code> mode, OpenJPA uses a left outer join (or inner
join, if the relations' field metadata declares the relation non-nullable) to
select the related data along with the data for the target objects. This process
works recursively for to-one joins, so that if <code class="classname">Person</code> has
an <code class="classname">Address</code>, and <code class="classname">Address</code> has a
<code class="classname">TelephoneNumber</code>, and the fetch groups are configured
correctly, OpenJPA might issue a single select that joins across the tables for
all three classes. To-many joins can not recursively spawn other to-many joins,
but they can spawn recursive to-one joins.
                </p><p>
Under the <code class="literal">join</code> subclass fetch mode, subclass data in joined
tables is selected by outer joining to all possible subclass tables of the type
being queried. As you'll see below, subclass data fetching is configured 
separately from relation fetching, and can be disabled for specific classes.
                </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Some databases may not support outer joins. Also, OpenJPA can not use
outer joins if you have set the <a href="ref_guide_conf_jdbc.html#openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" title="6.2.&nbsp; openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary">
<code class="literal"> DBDictionary</code></a>'s <code class="literal">JoinSyntax</code> to
<code class="literal">traditional</code>. See <a href="ref_guide_dbsetup_sql92.html" title="6.&nbsp; Setting the SQL Join Syntax">Section&nbsp;6, &#8220;
            Setting the SQL Join Syntax
        &#8221;</a>.
                    </p></div></li><li><p>
                <a class="indexterm" name="d0e26738"></a>
<code class="literal">parallel</code>: Under this mode, OpenJPA selects to-one relations
and joined collections as outlined in the <code class="literal">join</code> mode
description above. Unjoined collection fields, however, are eagerly fetched
using a separate select statement for each collection, executed in parallel with
the select statement for the target objects. The parallel selects use the
<code class="literal">WHERE</code> conditions from the primary select, but add their own
joins to reach the related data. Thus, if you perform a query that returns 100
<code class="classname">Company</code> objects, where each company has a list of
<code class="classname">Employee</code> objects and <code class="classname">Department</code>
objects, OpenJPA will make 3 queries. The first will select the company objects,
the second will select the employees for those companies, and the third will
select the departments for the same companies. Just as for joins, this process
can be recursively applied to the objects in the relations being eagerly
fetched. Continuing our example, if the <code class="classname">Employee</code> class
had a list of <code class="classname">Projects</code> in one of the fetch groups being
loaded, OpenJPA would execute a single additional select in parallel to load the
projects of all employees of the matching companies.
                </p><p>
Using an additional select to load each collection avoids transferring more data
than necessary from the database to the application. If eager joins were used
instead of parallel select statements, each collection added to the configured
fetch groups would cause the amount of data being transferred to rise
dangerously, to the point that you could easily overwhelm the network.
                </p><p>
Polymorphic to-one relations to table-per-class mappings use parallel eager
fetching because proper joins are impossible. You can force other to-one
relations to use parallel rather than join mode eager fetching using the
metadata extension described in <a href="ref_guide_mapping_ext.html#eager-fetch-mode" title="9.2.1.&nbsp; Eager Fetch Mode">Section&nbsp;9.2.1, &#8220;
                    Eager Fetch Mode
                &#8221;</a>.
                </p><p>
Parallel subclass fetch mode only applies to queries on joined inheritance
hierarchies. Rather than outer-joining to
subclass tables, OpenJPA will issue the query separately for each subclass. In
all other situations, parallel subclass fetch mode acts just like join mode in
regards to vertically-mapped subclasses.
                </p><p>
When OpenJPA knows that it is selecting for a single object only, it never uses
<code class="literal">parallel</code> mode, because the additional selects can be made
lazily just as efficiently. This mode only increases efficiency over <code class="literal">
join</code> mode when multiple objects with eager relations are being loaded,
or when multiple selects might be faster than joining to all possible
subclasses.

You can control OpenJPA's default eager fetch mode through the
<a href="ref_guide_conf_jdbc.html#openjpa.jdbc.EagerFetchMode" title="6.4.&nbsp; openjpa.jdbc.EagerFetchMode"><code class="literal">
openjpa.jdbc.EagerFetchMode</code></a> and
<a href="ref_guide_conf_jdbc.html#openjpa.jdbc.SubclassFetchMode" title="6.16.&nbsp; openjpa.jdbc.SubclassFetchMode"><code class="literal">
openjpa.jdbc.SubclassFetchMode</code></a> configuration properties. Set
each of these properties to one of the mode names described in the previous
section: <code class="literal">none, join, parallel</code>. If left unset, the eager
fetch mode defaults to <code class="literal">parallel</code> and the subclass fetch mode
defaults to <code class="literal">join</code> These are generally the most robust and
performant strategies.
            </p><p>
You can easily override the default fetch modes at runtime for any lookup or
query through OpenJPA's fetch configuration APIs. See
<a href="ref_guide_runtime.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp; Runtime Extensions">Chapter&nbsp;9, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

You can specify a default subclass fetch mode for an individual class with the
metadata extension described in <a href="ref_guide_mapping_ext.html#subclass-fetch-mode" title="9.1.1.&nbsp; Subclass Fetch Mode">Section&nbsp;9.1.1, &#8220;
                    Subclass Fetch Mode
                &#8221;</a>.
Note, however, that you cannot "upgrade" the runtime fetch mode with your class
setting. If the runtime fetch mode is <code class="literal">none</code>, no eager
subclass data fetching will take place, regardless of your metadata setting.
            </p><p>
This applies to the eager fetch mode metadata extension as well (see
<a href="ref_guide_mapping_ext.html#eager-fetch-mode" title="9.2.1.&nbsp; Eager Fetch Mode">Section&nbsp;9.2.1, &#8220;
                    Eager Fetch Mode
                &#8221;</a>). You can use this extension to
disable eager fetching on a field or to declare that a collection would rather
use joins than parallel selects or vice versa. But an extension value of
<code class="literal">join</code> won't cause any eager joining if the fetch
configuration's setting is <code class="literal">none</code>.

                Eager Fetching Considerations and Limitations
            </h3></div></div></div><p>
There are several important points that you should consider when using eager
fetching:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    <a class="indexterm" name="d0e26871"></a>
                    <a class="indexterm" name="d0e26877"></a>
When you are using <code class="literal">parallel</code> eager fetch mode and you have
large result sets enabled (see <a href="ref_guide_dbsetup_lrs.html" title="10.&nbsp; Large Result Sets">Section&nbsp;10, &#8220;
            Large Result Sets
        &#8221;</a>)
or you place a range on a query, OpenJPA performs the needed parallel selects on
one page of results at a time. For example, suppose your <code class="literal">
FetchBatchSize</code> is set to 20, and you perform a large result set query
on a class that has collection fields in the configured fetch groups. OpenJPA
will immediately cache the first <code class="literal">20</code> results of the query
using <code class="literal">join</code> mode eager fetching only. Then, it will issue the
extra selects needed to eager fetch your collection fields according to
<code class="literal">parallel</code> mode. Each select will use a SQL <code class="literal">IN
</code> clause (or multiple <code class="literal">OR</code> clauses if your class has a
compound primary key) to limit the selected collection elements to those owned
by the 20 cached results.
                    </p><p>
Once you iterate past the first 20 results, OpenJPA will cache the next 20 and
again issue any needed extra selects for collection fields, and so on. This
pattern ensures that you get the benefits of eager fetching without bringing
more data into memory than anticipated.
                    </p></li><li><p>
Once OpenJPA eager-joins into a class, it cannot issue any further eager to-many
joins or parallel selects from that class in the same query. To-one joins,
however, can recurse to any level.
                    </p></li><li><p>
Using a to-many join makes it impossible to determine the number of instances
the result set contains without traversing the entire set. This is because each
result object might be represented by multiple rows. Thus, queries with a range
specification or queries configured for lazy result set traversal automatically
turn off eager to-many joining.
                    </p></li><li><p>
OpenJPA cannot eagerly join to polymorphic relations to non-leaf classes in a
table-per-class inheritance hierarchy. You can work around this restriction
using the mapping extensions described in <a href="ref_guide_mapping_ext.html#nonpolymorphic" title="9.2.2.&nbsp; Nonpolymorphic">Section&nbsp;9.2.2, &#8220;
                    Nonpolymorphic
