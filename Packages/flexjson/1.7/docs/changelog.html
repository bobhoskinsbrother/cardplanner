    <h1>Flexjson Change Log</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.5</h2>
    <h3>Sept 26, 2007</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added support for wildcarding fields (exclude *.class).  This allows you to include and exclude fields
                    through wildcards.  Wildcarding is not used to serialize deeper in the graph.  The only way to
                    serialize deeply is by explicitly naming a path like( foo.bar.baz ), or using deeplySerialize().
                    Wildcards simply act off the portion of the output specified in the other fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Includes and excludes are processed in the order they were added to the serializer.  Includes and
                    excludes were previously processed by processing all includes first then processing the excludes.
                    That ment and include would override an exclude always.  This has changed since wildcarding can catch
                    more fields that you expect.  Say you did a wildcard include, and there was one field you wanted to
                    exclude.  In the previous algorithm you couldn't do that, but now you can place the exclude before
                    the include and it will filter out just that field.  All other fields would pass through and get
                    matched by the wildcard include.  <span class="important">This is a very important change for existing
                    users.  Analyze your includes/excludes for these changes</span>!  If you need the previous behavior
                    simply do your includes before your excludes (i.e. new JSONSerializer().include(...).exclude(...).serialize( myobj ) )
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added support for transformations.  Transformations allow you provide additional data substituion
                    on specific fields.  This comes in handy for doing things like HTML encoding values like
                    &lt;, &gt;, or &amp;, converting markdown text into HTML text, etc.  This allows you to execute
                    these types of manipulations on your server instead of in the browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added prettyPrint() method so that output can be pretty printed for development.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bug Fixes
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Strings containing '/' characters were being escaped unnecessarily.  Removed the escaping of '/' in
                    strings.  Thanks to Mendy Glazer for pointing this one out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed unnecessary whitespace from the output from serialize() saving about 5% of the size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When cycles were encountered in the object graph Flexjson could output bad json particularly with
                    collections.  Usually this ment an extra comma was added when it shouldn't be.  Now for maps,
                    arrays, properties of objects, and other collections it will first check to see if any output was
                    created before putting the comma in the output.  Thanks to Mendy Glazer for this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Declared fields in base classes weren't being serialized.  Now Flexjson will traverse up the
                    heirarchy and serialize any public non-static, non-transient field it encounters.  Thanks to
                    Miroslav Pokorny for finding this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Documentation was incorrect about serializing many-to-one and one-to-one relationships.  They are
                    automatically serialized by default.  If you don't want many-to-one or one-to-one relationships
                    serialized use the exclude() method to omit them.  Thanks to Steve Schmitt for pointing this out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hibernate proxies could cause trouble if you tried to serialize them.  Flexjson tries to inspect
                    the interfaces of each object to figure out it's fields.  Hibernate Proxies are not inspectable
                    in this way.  Flexjson will recognize Hiberate Proxies and dig into them to find the actual proxied
                    object.  BEWARE:  A Hibernate Proxy usually indicates that you haven't loaded this object through
                    lazy initialization.  That means when Flexjson tries to dig the real object out of the proxy it can
                    trip Hibernate to go back to the DB and load that object.  <span class="important">This is very
                    inefficient!  Analyze how you are loading your objects from the DB, and make sure you are eagerly
                    loading all of your objects you plan to serialize.</span>  Remember if flexjson is walking over a
                    relationship it shouldn't, use an exclude() to turn it off!  Thanks to Max Grigoriev.

    <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
    <h3>May 22, 2007</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added deepSerialize method to serialize a Java object recursively.  Includes, excludes, and
                    annotations are honored.  However, using includes really only matters if you are overiding
                    an annotation that is excluding a field by default.  Cycles in the graph are ignored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bug Fixes
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made Flexjson output conform to JSON standard.  The serialization of dates is not standardized by
                    the JSON spec.  However, you cannot use the new keyword in the JSON output according to the spec.
                    So the JSON Flexjson was emitting in the previous was not JSON compliant because it would write out
                    <code>new Date( ... )</code>.  It has been changed to send the time as the number of milliseconds
                    since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cycles in the graph produced a StackOverflowException.  Objects that had circular references
                    would produce StackOverflowException.  While you could workaround this issue using excludes or
                    annotations the code was now fixed to prevent the stack overflows by default and not serialize
                    cycles.  Any cycle in the graph will be ignored.
                </li>
